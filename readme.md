# Cocktail App

Cocktail App is a fun way to find new cocktails to make for you and your friends. You can search a free to use cocktail database: https://rapidapi.com/theapiguy/api/the-cocktail-db by ingredient or lookup a random cocktail.

## Purpose

The app is written entirely in HTML/CSS/vanilla JS and is free to use and adapt for other database applications. This is a learning application to understand more about DOM manipulation, routing, and the advantages of using frameworks, while knowing that you can get by without them.

## Limitations

Unfortunately, the Cocktail API itself comes with a few limitations. Namely, it is difficult to search for multiple ingredients and you cannot search by drink name. It should be relatively easy to fix the former problem within the app by making multiple API calls and cross-checking the resulting lists.
